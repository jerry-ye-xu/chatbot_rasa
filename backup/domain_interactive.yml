  utter_goodbye:
  - text: Cya! All the best on your data science journey! =)
  - text: Bye bye! Thanks for coming on and chatting with me! =)
  utter_greet:
  - text: Hi there! How are you going?
  - text: G'day mate how's it going?
  - text: It's nice to meet you.
  - text: What do you and I have in common? We're both awesome.
  utter_help_message:
  - text: Sorry, I'm not really sure about that. Try asking something else related
      to data science careers.
  utter_iamabot:
  - text: I am the ANOVA-bot, a new form of super intelligence.
  - text: 'One may say that I am a bot. '
  utter_purpose_of_existence:
  - text: My name is ANOVA-bot. I help students and graduates explore the idea of
      data science as a career.
  - text: I am but an ANOVA-bot. I exist to share my knowledge about data science
      careers to students and graduates.
  - text: bot. ANOVA-bot. I help students and graduates explore the idea of data science
      as a career.
  utter_random_fact:
  - text: ANOVA is a statistical test that analyses differences amongst group means
      in a sample.
  - text: Estimating alpha and beta coefficients in simple linear regression using
      maximum likelihood is equivalent to the standard formulaic method if certain
      normality conditions are met.
  - text: Rao-Blackwellisation guarantees that if you condition an estimator g(X)
      on a sufficient statistic T(X), the result is never worse than the original
      estimator.
  - text: We can use the duality theorem to prove that the maximum flow of a network
      is equivalent to a minimum cut.
  - text: Word embeddings are not complicated - it is just a n-dimensional vector
      representation of text at the word-level. There are many word embedding representations
      such as Word2Vec, GloVe and FastText.
  - text: We can actually use the Residual Theorem, a concept in Complex Analysis,
      to evaluate real integrals.
  - text: Tensorflow Hub hosts many pre-trained models that you could re-use for your
      specific purposes.
  - text: Whilst principal component analysis is a dimension reduction technique that
      transforms the data into components with the largest variance as the 1st component,
      canonical component analysis finds linear combinations of two vectors that have
      maximum correlation.
  - text: Bayesian statistics is founded on the idea of prior knowledge and how much
      our understanding of a phenomena shifts given new evidence.
  - text: Sorry I've ran out of random facts, but you could keep asking me for them...
  utter_response_to_insult:
  - text: That's not very nice.
  - text: Please do not insult me.
  - text: Be nice to your fellow chatbots.
  utter_sadface:
  - text: Awww =(
  - text: Okay then =(
  utter_smile:

  - text: That's great!
  - text: Awesome!
  utter_thanks:
  - text: Thanks for that.
  utter_user_purpose:
  - text: So, are you here to learn a bit more about data science?
  - text: Do you want to hear a little more about data science?
  - text: Does the prospect of a data science career sound intriguing?
  utter_your_welcome:
  - text: Glad I helped!
  - text: No worries mate!

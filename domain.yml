  utter_random_fact:
  - text: "ANOVA is a statistical test that analyses differences amongst group means in a sample."
  - text: "Estimating alpha and beta coefficients in simple linear regression using maximum likelihood is equivalent to the standard formulaic method if certain normality conditions are met."
  - text: "Rao-Blackwellisation guarantees that if you condition an estimator g(X) on a sufficient statistic T(X), the result is never worse than the original estimator."
  - text: "We can use the duality theorem to prove that the maximum flow of a network is equivalent to a minimum cut."
  - text: "Word embeddings are not complicated - it is just a n-dimensional vector representation of text at the word-level. There are many word embedding representations such as Word2Vec, GloVe and FastText."
  - text: "We can actually use the Residual Theorem, a concept in Complex Analysis, to evaluate real integrals."
  - text: "Tensorflow Hub hosts many pre-trained models that you could re-use for your specific purposes."
  - text: "Whilst principal component analysis is a dimension reduction technique that transforms the data into components with the largest variance as the 1st component, canonical component analysis finds linear combinations of two vectors that have maximum correlation."
  - text: "Bayesian statistics is founded on the idea of prior knowledge and how much our understanding of a phenomena shifts given new evidence."
  - text: "Sorry I've ran out of random facts, but you could keep asking me for them..."
